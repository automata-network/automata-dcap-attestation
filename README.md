## Summary

This repo serves as a code base for the Intel Data Center Attestation Primitive (DCAP) Web3-based Quote Verification program for both EVM and Solana.

Currently on the EVM, users can verify DCAP quotes with either full on-chain execution or using SNARK proofs by executing [DCAP zkVM Programs](https://github.com/automata-network/tdx-attestation-sdk/tree/main/zk) on zkVMs, such as RiscZero or Succinct SP1. We plan to add support for more zkVMs in the future.

The Solana program supports only SNARK proof verification.

---

## Deployment Info

Each release contains information about the deployment, such as:

- The zkVM Program Identifiers (ensuring SNARK proofs are generated by the correct zkVM Program)
- The contract addresses on EVM and/or Solana (and possibly other ecosystem that we may support in the future)

Here are the deployment information for currently active versions:

- [Current](./releases/v1.1/NOTE.md)
- [v1.0](./releases/v1.0/NOTE.md)

## Automata DCAP Attestation Rust Workspace

The Rust workspace provides a comprehensive toolkit for Intel DCAP quote verification and attestation, including pure Rust implementations of Intel's DCAP QVL, zkVM proof generation libraries (supporting RISC Zero, SP1, and Pico), and a unified CLI tool for testing and examples. For detailed information about the workspace layout, available libraries, and CLI usage, see the [Rust workspace README](./rust-crates/README.md).

## Automata DCAP Attestation on EVM

### Audit Reports:

- [2025-02 Automata Onchain PCCS and DCAP EVM Contract Audit by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-02-automata-dcap-attestation-onchain-pccs-securityreview.pdf)

Comprehensive audit targeted both Automata Onchain PCCS and Automata DCAP EVM contracts based on the [v1.0](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-dcap-attestation/releases/tag/v1.0.0) release.

- [2025-10 Jovay-TEE-Verifier Audit by OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/jovaynetwork/jovay-docs/blob/main/security-reports/202510/Jovay-TEE-Verifier-Audit-2025.10.pdf)

Jovay TEE implemented its own TEE Verifier contract, which is dependent on Automata DCAP Contract. Although, the exact commit of the codebase is undisclosed, the report mentioned the use of V5 Quote Verifier and raised issues regarding collateral timestamp validity check in the PCCS Router. This issue [has been fixed](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-dcap-attestation/pull/52/commits/62466820089a124ac872e6cedbae2a4cdae416b0) as part of the current v1.1 release.

It consists of three smart contracts:

- PCCS Router: A central contract to read collaterals from [`automata-on-chain-pccs`](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-on-chain-pccs)

- Automata DCAP Attestation: This is the entrypoint contract for users to submit a quote to be verified. This contract parses the Quote header to identify the version, which then forwards the quote to the respective QuoteVerifier contract. 

- Quote Verifier(s): This contract provides the full implementation to verify a given quote specific to its version. This contract is intended to be called only from the Automata DCAP Attestation contract.

### On-Chain vs SNARK Attestations

Automata DCAP Attestation contract implements two attestation methods available to users. Here is a quick comparison:

|  | On-Chain | Groth16 Proof Verification with RiscZero v3 | Groth16 Proof Verification with SP1 v5 | Plonk Proof Verification with SP1 v5| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quote Verification Time | Instant | Proving takes <1 minute, instant verification | [Proving takes <30s](https://explorer.succinct.xyz/request/0x07af234869635075dcbc714135ea52c71b9019ffda59e33d3aa5fb6673a724d2), instant verification  | [Proving takes <2 minutes](https://explorer.succinct.xyz/request/0x64bc5f55b3425cc8e6400597765c656c8ab4a7c18de04719e9f6595703ea9c04), instant verification |
| Gas Cost | ~4M gas (with RIP-7212 precompile); ~5M gas (without precompile) | 522k gas | 493k gas | 569k gas |
| Execution | Runs fully on-chain | Execution proven by remote prover Bonsai | Execution proven by the SP1 Network | Execution proven by the SP1 Network |

## Automata DCAP Attestation on Solana

> [!CAUTION]
>
> The Solana programs are not audited for production use.

> ℹ️ **NOTE:**
>
> We are currently working on full-fledged DCAP Attestation for the Solana ecosystem, which consists of both the Quote Verifiers and PCCS programs. You can learn more about it [here](./solana/automata-dcap-framework/README.md).
