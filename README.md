## Summary

This repo serves as a code base for the Intel Data Center Attestation Primitive (DCAP) Web3-based Quote Verification program for both EVM and Solana.

Currently on the EVM, users can verify DCAP quotes with either full on-chain execution or using SNARK proofs by executing [DCAP zkVM Programs](https://github.com/automata-network/tdx-attestation-sdk/tree/main/zk) on zkVMs, such as RiscZero or Succinct SP1. We plan to add support for more zkVMs in the future.

The Solana program currently supports only SNARK proof verification.

---

## Deployment Info

Each release contains information about the deployment, such as:

- The zkVM Program Identifiers (ensuring SNARK proofs are generated by the correct zkVM Program)
- The contract addresses on EVM and/or Solana (and possibly in other ecosystem that we may support in the future)

Here are the deployment information for currently active versions:

- [Current](./releases/next/NOTE.md)
- [v1.0.0](./releases/v1.0.0/NOTE.md)

## Automata DCAP Attestation on EVM

It consists of three smart contracts:

- PCCS Router: A central contract to read collaterals from [`automata-on-chain-pccs`](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-on-chain-pccs)

- Automata DCAP Attestation: This is the entrypoint contract for users to submit a quote to be verified. This contract parses the Quote header to identify the version, which then forwards the quote to the respective QuoteVerifier contract. 

- Quote Verifier(s): This contract provides the full implementation to verify a given quote specific to its version. This contract is intended to be called only from the Automata DCAP Attestation contract.

### On-Chain vs SNARK Attestations

Automata DCAP Attestation contract implements two attestation methods available to users. Here is a quick comparison:

|  | On-Chain | Groth16 Proof Verification with RiscZero v2.1 | Groth16 Proof Verification with SP1 v5 | Plonk Proof Verification with SP1 v5| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quote Verification Time | Instant | Proving takes <1 minute, instant verification | [Proving takes <30s](https://explorer.succinct.xyz/request/0x07af234869635075dcbc714135ea52c71b9019ffda59e33d3aa5fb6673a724d2), instant verification  | [Proving takes <2 minutes](https://explorer.succinct.xyz/request/0x64bc5f55b3425cc8e6400597765c656c8ab4a7c18de04719e9f6595703ea9c04), instant verification |
| Gas Cost | ~4M gas (with RIP-7212 precompile); ~5M gas (without precompile) | 522k gas | 493k gas | 569k gas |
| Execution | Runs fully on-chain | Execution proven by remote prover Bonsai | Execution proven by the SP1 Network | Execution proven by the SP1 Network |

## Automata DCAP Attestation on Solana

> [!CAUTION]
>
> The Solana programs are not audited for production use.

### Overview

The following diagram illustrates an overview of the execution flow of the DCAP Solana Program.

![DCAP Solana Diagram](./solana/docs/images/DCAP%20Solana%20Diagram.jpg)

1. Invokes the `CreateDcapOutputAccount` instruction on the DCAP Program.
2. Reads the current count from DCAP Counter, which is used as seed to derive the address of the `VerifiedOutput` PDA.
3. Writes data to the `VerifiedOutput` PDA.
4. Increments the current count in DCAP Counter, which completes the `CreateDcapOutputAccount` instruction.
5. Invokes the `VerifyDcapProof` instruction on the DCAP Program.
6. Reads the output from the provided `VerifiedOutput` PDA address.
7. The output is pre-processed and converted into a Groth16 public input, then submitted along with the proofs to be verified with the corresponding zkVM verifier program.
8. Updates the data in `VerifiedOutput` PDA to indicate the status showing successful verification.
9. Downstream programs consume the data directly from the `VerifiedOutput` PDA.

### zkVM Verifier Programs

Depending on which zkVM programs that the user has chosen, the Automata DCAP Solana Program sends the processed `VerifiedOutput` along with proofs to one of the following programs:

- [RiscZero Groth16 Verifier](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-solana/blob/main/solana-verifier/programs/groth_16_verifier/src/lib.rs), this is a general-purpose Groth16 Verifier built by RiscZero that can be called by any Solana programs to perform Groth16 Verifications.

- [DCAP SP1 Solana Program](./solana/programs/dcap-sp1-solana-program/), this is a wrapper verifier program to be called only by the Automata DCAP Solana Program because it hardcodes the vkey. This program imports the [SP1 Solana Library](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-solana/blob/master/example/program/src/lib.rs).

### Deployment

The DCAP Solana Program and Counter account have both been deployed to `devnet` at:

- DCAP Program: `DcapE9GZZ2KSu6udeW1pVdmqBAHP9NMBLBrxUUYdw1Qk`
- DCAP Counter: `DcapH8Bt1y6MQHE1hR2Rp1WEBeWfog2Kh9UxtG8UMaNu`
